A simple bubble popping game made in Unity with a dual purpose: to provide a calming experience for gamers on the autism spectrum and a chance to learn to make simple games with Unity and get an introduction to game development.

## Roadmap

### Scope & Platform

We hope to distrubute our game on Android and iOS, with working table tand web versions if time allows.  **Minimum viable product**: a simple tapping mechanic that destroyes objects. To support such functionaly we implement the following basic parts:

1. A reusable bubble component.
2. A bubble spawner.
3. Tapping.

### Experience

Ideally, playing our game should be a calming, repetative experience, perhaps in the vein of some "not-games" like _Venture Capitalist_, but without leveling mechanics that may cause stress.

### Juice

After implementing the minimum viable product we hope to complete some feature passes to add polish to the experience.
